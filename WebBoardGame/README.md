#Web-based board game.#

Implemented in python. Using Django and javascript, the web-side is implemented.

This project is implemented phase by phase. Currently only back-end side is implemented.

In the last phase I am going to finalize the project with javascript.



In order to play the game, first in the main directory run:

python manage.py runserver

After that, you can use your browser to open the page 127.0.0.1:8000

You can register then login to play.

Since the front-end is not fully implemented commands are given as html post requests.

You can join into any game by given its ID as input and while playing to you can usu 1 or 0 to respond to pick, roll requests.
